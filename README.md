# APFACE+: Comprehensive Skin Analysis Application

## Project Overview
APFACE+ is an innovative application designed to provide comprehensive facial skin analysis through two primary models:
1. **Skin Condition Classification**
2. **Skin Type Classification**

## Problem Statement
Many individuals lack professional dermatological resources, making it challenging to:
- Identify potential skin conditions early
- Understand their unique skin characteristics

## Research Objectives
1. Develop highly accurate machine learning models for:
   - Detecting and classifying facial skin conditions
   - Determining individual skin types
2. Create an accessible, user-friendly skin analysis tool
3. Ensure model reliability across diverse demographic groups

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Skin Condition Classification Model
- **Purpose**: Identify and classify various facial skin conditions
- **Potential Conditions Detected**:
  - Acne
  - Blackhead
  - Freckles
  - Redness

### 2. Skin Type Classification Model
- **Purpose**: Determine individual skin characteristics
- **Skin Types Classified**:
  - Normal
  - Dry
  - Oily

## Technical Stack
